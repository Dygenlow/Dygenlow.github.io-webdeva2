            <div>
                <p>
                    Regular running or jogging offers many health benefits. Running can:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>help to build strong bones, as it is a weight bearing exercise</li>
                    <li>strengthen muscles</li>
                    <li>improve cardiovascular fitness</li>
                    <li>burn plenty of kilojoules</li>
                    <li>help maintain a healthy weight.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    An inactive lifestyle is associated with higher mortality,coronary artery disease, hypertension and stroke. <br>
                    It is also a primary cause of most chronic diseases, as the body rapidly adapts to insufficient physical <br>
                    activity which results in substantially reduced quality of life.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Regular physical activity such as running can significantly improve mental health, 
                    self-confidence, healthy ageing, and quality of life.

                    Think about what you want to achieve from running or jogging. Issues to consider may include:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Getting fit</b> - if you're a beginner, you should start with brisk walking, 
                        progress to jogging and work up to running. This should take a few months.
                    </li>

                    <br>

                    <li>
                        <b>General fitness</b> - mix your running with other forms of exercise 
                        (such as swimming or team sports) to maximise your overall fitness.
                    </li>

                    <br>

                    <li>
                        <b>Weight loss</b> - adjust your diet to include plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables, lean meats, 
                        wholegrain cereals and low-fat dairy products. Cut back on dietary fats, takeaway foods, soft drinks and sugar.
                    </li>

                    <br>

                    <li>
                        <b>Companionship</b> - you could run with a friend or join a local running club.
                    </li>

                    <br>

                    <li>
                    <b>Competition</b> - running clubs may offer competitive events. <br>
                        Most clubs have sessions designed for beginners through to advanced runners. <br>
                        You can pit your running skills against others in fun runs or marathons. <br>
                        Many community-based running events cater for people of all ages and abilities. <br>
                        Join a local orienteering club to combine running with the challenge of navigating through various environments.
                    </li>

            <h2>Make jogging fun</h2>

            <div>
                <p>
                    Running is hard. This is a generally accepted universal truth â€” at least amongst beginners. <br>
                    But there are tonnes of things every runner can do to make the process a lot more enjoyable, <br>
                    helping you become the sort of runner who actually really loves it.
                </p>

                <br>

                <!-- Point #1 -->
                <div class="box">
                    <div class="js-toggle" data-container="toggle-1">
                        <h3>1. Make It Easy</h3>

                        <p>
                            Most beginners go out too hard and fast and run themselves into the ground. <br>
                            It does not have to be that hard, especially when starting out.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            Try breaking the run into chunks of time. Walk a bit, run a bit; or run a bit, jog a bit. <br>
                            Why not start with 15-30s blocks of running and 1-2 minutes of walking? <br>
                            This will give you a chance to build up not just the lung capacity to run for longer, <br>
                            but the capacity through your joints and your mind.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            Try to maintain a conversational pace. This means running a lot slower than you think. <br>
                            If you couldn't hold a conversation, it's too fast. Make it easier.
                        </p>

                            Two is better than one! Bring a friend along on your run to instantly make your run more fun. <br>
                            Slow down the pace so you can talk or challenge each other by pushing the pace a little faster than you would on your own.

                            or trails with you - search for local running clubs. Many running clubs often meet up at public places, <br>
                            and the great thing is they're filled with people who are into running and can provide encouragement <br>
                            and motivation in your journey, as well as endless tips to help you become a better runner!

                            Perhaps the biggest reason I love running is the unique perspective you get of wherever you are. <br>
                            Whether seeing my own hometown from a new angle or route or exploring the streets by foot when <br>
                            on vacation - you'll never see the world quite the same as when you're on a run! But if you <br>
                            don't pause to intentionally take it all in, you might just miss it.
                        </p>
        
                        <p>
                            Pull yourself out of your head (and your pain) and take in your surroundings. <br>
                            The beautiful outdoors is a great distraction from your run and can make you <br>
                            feel more like you're on an exciting adventure than working out.

                            When it comes to music - listen to whatever makes you happy. Running to upbeat <br>
                            music can help boost your mood and performance. I recommend building your <br>
                            playlist in advance so you don't have to mess with your music on your run.
